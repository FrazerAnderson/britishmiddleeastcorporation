            <h1>A. Michael Cutler-Hodgson</h1>
            <h3>Chairman & Managing Director - BMEC</h3>
            <h3>Feb 2009 - Present (14 years and 2 months)</h3>
            <p>My multifaceted career from time served engineering technician, through the ranks of supervisory, middle & higher management to C-level executive management (and beyond), progressed and evolved during and throughout different job roles and professional appointments, primarily in the industry sectors of Commerce, Finance, Manufacturing, Tourism and Trade. Top companies/groups working in 'engineering, manufacturing & production', 'insurance & financial services', 'real-estate, tourism development, airlines, aviation & shipping services', 'business consultancy' and 'international trade', all provided and contributed, as did the diversity and multiple skill sets acquired or learned throughout. Further enhanced by the business, cultural and social experiences derived from living and working in a number of countries around the world, I have both founded and hold directorships with several private sector companies, as well as providing consultancy services to others. Personally, I am principled and well-disciplined, a good 'people' person, and always enjoy a challenge. Professionally, I am pragmatic, and highly experienced in such areas as 'arranging, planning and organizing', 'asset backed financial engineering', 'contracts and corporate law', 'international trade & commerce', 'problem solving in general', ''sales' training & management' and 'transactional facilitation'. Socially, I enjoy travelling, meeting people, exchanging views and opinions, worldly music, nature, and good food. Finally, and as applied throughout all of the above, I also advocate the principles of 'democracy', 'government & citizenship', and 'international law', and on a daily basis, act based on the foundations of fundamental 'common sense'!</p>

                <h2>Michael Cutler-Hodgson</h2>
                
                <p>During international trade week last November, Peter Bishop met with Michael Cutler- Hodgson, chair and managing director of BMEC (British Middle East Corporation), who epitomises the British pioneering spirit in overseas markets

                If the UK is going to prosper in the post-Brexit trade world, it needs clones of Michael Cutler-Hodgson. His background is fascinating and his experience vast. He started out with a hybrid engineering apprenticeship in Manchester - backing that discipline and ending up many years later with a degree in
                business/managerial economics.

                Following that technical apprenticeship and a few years in supervisory management, he moved on from a UK top 100 group company to the Oliver machinery company, the European subsidiary of a century-old American "high grade woodworking machinery manufacturer" famed for its tradition and innovation. He was then headhunted into the world of insurance. He clearly had a talent for sales and, as per the then McQuaig psychometric test, was told he had the "perfect profile" for the industry.

                </p>
                <h3>Traditional</h3>
                <p>Some years and locations (Cyprus, Greece and Spain) later, and keen to be his own boss, Cutler-Hodgson became aware of the market potential and needs prevailing in Egypt. Recreational tourism was developing alongside the traditional  historical type, and he set himself up in Cairo in the mid-90s.
                Tourism industry development both encompasses and complements a variety of commercial sectors, and he added resort development, aviation, and shipping to his portfolio. He also developed deep knowledge and appreciation of working with different cultures, traditions, and business models spending months in markets such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, and together with his previous stints, picking up Arabic, Greek, and Spanish in the process.
                 </p>
                <h3>No pain, no gain</h3>
                <p>This eventually led to his establishment of BMEC. How would he describe it? "In basic terms, we facilitated trade
                between the UK and the Middle East - but of course 'trade' being global, connections are soon made with other regions and I added Uzbekistan.

                "We operate as agents, brokers, traders and consultants with an emphasis on energy and commodities. We also act as both merchant and distributor - there are times when you need to take title - no pain, no gain you might say."
                </p>
                <h3>Practical</h3>
                <p>Cutler-Hodgson's international trade advice, connections and introductions, has been sought often by many others, notably government departments, but he is a modest and practical man and is not above seeking guidance from others. Last year he contacted LCCI for assistance relating to customs requirements associated with trade in precious metals - predominantly gold. He was facilitating shipments from various markets into the UK for processing and re-export for industrial or investment purposes and needed clarification on duty and VAT payments. The chamber team, led by Suvjeet Sibia, were able to "check, advise and confirm" how he should proceed.
                </p>
                <h3>Inspiring</h3>
                <p>Michael Cutler-Hodgson's enthusiasm for, literally, flying the flag and championing British trade is boundless. He sums it up as follows. "Can you imagine what it is like driving in the sand dunes crossing from mainland Egypt to Sinai? You don't see the vessel travelling down the Suez Canal, you only see the vessel cargo floating past the sand dunes, a pretty awesome sight. Imagine then when in the midst
                of all of the stacked containers you see one container overpainted with 'From London with Love' and the Union Jack- truly inspiring!"
