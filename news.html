        <h2>Facilitating, Financing and Bucking the trend</h2>
		<p>British Middle East Corporation celebrated 10 successful years of trading in February 2019. It was a decade of turbulence, but a decade within which we not only survived, but also managed to secure arrangements with several Banks, Financial Institutions and Collateral providers to better enable our capabilities via financial and fiduciary services when supporting justifiable transactional needs.

In February 2020, we completed our 11th successful year and the 1st year of our 2nd decade. A month later we all closed business due to the Covid-19 virus and the resulting global lockdown. Will this lead to another decade of turbulence, we will have to wait and see!

Our Corporate and Commercial goals remain the same!</p>
